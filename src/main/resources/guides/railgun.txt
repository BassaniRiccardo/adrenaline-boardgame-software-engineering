Railgun [(yellow), yellow, blue]
-------------------------

Basic effect:
	Choose a cardinal direction and 1 target in that direction. Deal 3 damage to it.

Secondary effect - Piercing Mode:
	Choose a cardinal direction and 1 or 2 targets in that direction. Deal 2 damage to each.

Notes:
	Basically, you're shooting in a straight line and ignoring walls. You don't have to pick a target on the other side of a wall – it could even be someone on your own square – but shooting through walls sure is fun. There are only 4 cardinal directions. You imagine facing one wall or door, square-on, and firing in that direction. Anyone on a square in that direction (including yours) is a valid target. In piercing mode, the 2 targets can be on the same square or on different squares.
