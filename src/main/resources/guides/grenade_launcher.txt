Grenade Launcher [(red)]
------------------------

Basic effect:
	Deal 1 damage to 1 target you can see. Then you may move the target 1 square.
Optional effect 1 - Extra grenade:
	Deal 1 damage to every player on a square you can see. You can use this before or after the basic effect's move. [red]

	Notes: For example, you can shoot a target, move it onto a square with other targets, then damage everyone including the first target. Or you can deal 2 to a main target, 1 to everyone else on that square, then move the main target. Or you can deal 1 to an isolated target and 1 to everyone on a different square. If you target your own square, you will not be moved or damaged.
