Flamethower [(red)]
------------------------

Basic effect:
	Choose a square 1 move away and possibly a second square 1 more move away in the same direction. On each square, you may choose 1 target and give it 1 damage.

Secondary effect 1 - Second Lock:
	Choose 2 squares as above. Deal 2 damage to everyone on the first square and 1 damage to everyone on the second square. [yellow, yellow]

	Notes: This weapon cannot damage anyone in your square. However, it can sometimes damage a target you can't see â€“ the flame won't go through walls, but it will go through doors. Think of it as a straight-line blast of flame that can travel 2 squares in a cardinal direction.
