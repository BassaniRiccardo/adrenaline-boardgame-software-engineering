Vortex Cannon [(red), blue]
------------------------

Basic effect:
	Choose a square you can see, but not your square. Call it "the vortex". Choose a target on the vortex or 1 move away from it. Move it onto the vortex and give it 2 damage.

Optional effect 1 - Black Hole:
	Choose up to 2 other targets on the vortex or 1 move away from it. Move them onto the vortex and give them each 1 damage. [red]

Notes:
	The 3 targets must be different, but some might start on the same square. It is legal to choose targets on your square, on the vortex, or even on squares you can't see. They all end up on the vortex.
