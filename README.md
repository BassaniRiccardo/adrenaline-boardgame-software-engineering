**Setup:**
- The server uses port 3994 for RMI and 4198 for TCP.
- Client parameters can be set at launch:

    java -jar client.jar [serverIP] [serverPort] [clientIP]
     
- If no args are provided, the client will try to read a client.properties file in the same folder as the jar.
- If this file is not available, default parameters will be loaded from those contained in resources/client.properties before building the jar.

- Server properties (IPs and ports) must be set in a server.property file, which can be either in the same folder as the jar file, or in /resources before building the jar.
The server will first check for properties in the same folder.
