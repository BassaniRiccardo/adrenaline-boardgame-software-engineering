-------------------------
Rocket Launcher [(red)]
-------------------------

Basic effect:
	Deal 2 damage to 1 target you can see that is not on your square. Then you may move the target 1 square.

Optional effect 1 - Rocket Jump:
	Move 1 or 2 squares. This effect can be used either before or after the basic effect. [blue]

Optional effect 2 - Fragmenting Warhead:
	Deal 1 additional damage to the other of those targets and/or deal 1 damage to a different target you can see. [yellow]

Notes:
	If you use the rocket jump before the basic effect, you consider only your new square when determining if a target is legal. You can even move off a square so you can shoot someone on it. If you use the fragmenting warhead, you deal damage to everyone on the target's square before you move the target â€“ your target will take 3 damage total.
